# HOMEDYNIP

Small utility to update dynamic DNS from inside your network when your ISP doesn't give you fixed public IP. If your internet box or other router doesn't integrate the dyndns client you want, deploy the homedynip server on any cloud provider and use the client part to get your own public IP.

This project is under development.
